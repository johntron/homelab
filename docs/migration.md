# Migration Plan: Rancher Harvester to Talos Kubernetes

## Current Setup
- High-availability Kubernetes cluster using Rancher Harvester
- Mix of Helm charts and raw YAML manifests in Git
- Manual installation using Helm and kubectl

## Migration Goals
1. Move to Talos for Kubernetes
2. Implement GitOps with Flux and Sealed Secrets
3. Transition from Helm to vanilla YAML with Kustomize
4. Retain: high-availability, cloud-native distributed storage, automatic replication, backups to MinIO

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Learning

1. Talos Minimal Viable Cluster
   - Set up a basic single-node Talos cluster for hands-on experience

2. Flux for a "Hello World" App
   - Deploy a simple application using Flux to introduce GitOps workflow

3. Kustomize a Basic Deployment
   - Convert an existing simple deployment from Harvester to Kustomize

4. Secret Management Proof-of-Concept
   - Experiment with Sealed Secrets by encrypting and deploying a simple secret

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Migration

5. Talos Cluster with Basic Networking
   - Provision a multi-node Talos cluster mimicking production network environment

6. Storage Migration for a Single Application
   - Migrate storage for a non-critical application, including CSI drivers setup

7. MinIO Backup and Restore
   - Configure MinIO on Talos and test backup/restore for the migrated application

### Phase 3: Application and Deployment Migration

8. Migrate a Simple Application with Flux
   - Convert Helm chart to Kustomize
   - Manage secrets with Sealed Secrets
   - Deploy to Talos using Flux

9. Migrate a Stateful Application
   - Perform same steps as previous slice
   - Focus on data migration and persistent volume handling

## Key Considerations
- Networking configuration
- Security measures
- Monitoring and logging
- Rollback strategy
